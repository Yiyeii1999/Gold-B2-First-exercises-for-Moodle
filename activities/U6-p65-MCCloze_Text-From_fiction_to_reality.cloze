<h4>From fiction to reality</h4>

<p>Science-fiction films have promised us many exciting gadgets. We have seen hoverboards, domestic robots and flying cars, to <strike><i>say</i></strike> / <strike><i>call</i></strike> / <strike><i>tell</i></strike> / <i><b>name</b></i> just a few, but most of these predictions have not come {1:MC:~=true~right~exact~correct} yet. Take, for example, the way I {1:MC:~=got~arrived~reached~appeared} to the office this morning: I came by bike {1:MC:~instead~=rather~sooner~except} than on a hoverboard. Not much has changed there, then â€“ the bicycle was invented in the nineteenth century! Almost the whole {1:MC:~drive~travel~voyage~=journey} was on a form of Tarmac, also invented that same century. Also, {1:MC:~for~=to~in~against} some people's surprise, robots haven't taken {1:MC:~up~off~=over~down} either the home or the workplace yet. On the other hand, in 1987 it was predicted in the TV series <i>Star Trek</i> that we would be using touchscreen technology before too long. So perhaps fiction doesn't always {1:MC:~make~do~=get~take} it wrong after all. Maybe the most astonishing development has been the microchip and its place in computers. The {1:MC:~end~=effect~result~solution} on our lives has been amazing,and this was never really predicted.</p>
