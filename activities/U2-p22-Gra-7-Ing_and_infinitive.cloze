She managed <b>(11)</b> {1:SA:=to persuade} (<i>persuade</i>) her cousins to start <b>(12)</b> {1:SA:=working} (<i>work</i>) with top fashion designers, such as Alexander McQueen. His 2009 collection inspired other designers <b>(13)</b> {1:SA:=to make} (<i>make</i>) fabulous creations with crystal and since then stars such as Beyonc√© and Rihanna have gone on <b>(14)</b> {1:SA:=to perform} (<i>perform</i>) in dresses covered in Swarovski crystal.</p>
