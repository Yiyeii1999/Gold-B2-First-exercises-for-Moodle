<h4>Food, glorious food</h4>

<p>These days it’s very hard to get people to agree (0) <i>on</i> anything. But there’s one thing we can all accept — people like food! However, what makes good food is {1:SA:=not# negative} a universal concept — something considered repulsive in one part of the world is a delicious lunch in another. For example, many of us {1:SA:=have#  part of the passive form} been brought up to believe that insects are for swatting rather {1:SA:=than#comparative } eating, but in fact {1:SA:=they#pronoun referring to insects } are an important part of the diet in many places and provide a valuable source of protein. Perhaps the problem really is that we have become too unadventurous — we are now so {1:SA:=used# part of ‘used to’} to vacuum-packed, tasteless ready-made meals that we are unwilling {1:SA:=to# infinitive after ‘unwilling’ } try anything unusual. Yet many less obvious combinations of food can change our tastes — simple touches {1:SA:=like# giving an example} combining carrots with sugar enhances their flavour — and how about trying strawberries with a bit {1:SA:=of#expression ‘a bit of’} pepper? There's food out there for everyone and if you look hard enough, you are sure to find somethmg you love.</p>
