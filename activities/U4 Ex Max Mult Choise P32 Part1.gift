<b>The science of happiness</b>
Some scientisis believe that asking people how happy they are is {1:MC:~=similar to~close to ~Typical of~consist of} asking them about an event they've attended in the past — there’s a lot they {1:MC:~gave~=took~got~kept} no notice of during the experience,so how do they know? These scientists think that anyone studying happiness should pay more {1:MC:~focus~concentration~=attention~regard} to people’s experiences at the time they occur, not afterwards.
Other scientists say that we are actually {1:MC:~=made~built~created~developed} up of our memories. They suggest that studying moment-to-moment experiences at the time {1:MC:~sets~=puts~fixes~rests} too much emphasis on temporary pleasures, and that happiness goes {1:MC:~stronger~lower~=deeper~greater} than that. They identify three key {1:MC:~=ingredients~parts~factors~items} for happiness: pleasure, engagement (how involved we are with family, work, romance and hobbies) and meaning (how we use our personal strengths to achieve important {1:MC:~intentions~plans~marks~=goals}. It is interesting that, {1:MC:~against~opposing~=contrary~contrast} to what might be expected, pleasure seems to play the smallest part in what makes us happy.
