<h5>Mothman</h5>
<p>Many years ago a strange creature was spotted in West Virginia in the USA. It looked like a man with wings and most witnesses claim it <strong>(1)</strong> {1:SA:=must have been}<em>(must/be)</em> nearly two metres tall; others say it <strong>(2)</strong> {1:SA:=may have had} <em>(may/have)</em> eyes in its chest. Nobody is very sure what this creature <strong>(3)</strong> {1:SA:=could have been~=could be} <em>(could/be).</em> Some people today think these witnesses <strong>(4)</strong> {1:SA:=might have mistaken} <em>(might/mistake)</em> big owls flying around for the creature. Others feel it <strong>(5)</strong> {1:SA:=must have been} <em>(must/be)</em> a UFO because there were also strange lights around it. And even people who think there <strong>(6)</strong> {1:SA:=can’t be~=can’t have been~=can't be~=can't have been} (can/ <em>be)</em> such things as a Mothman enjoy watching the films about it or visiting the four-metre sculpture in West Virginia.</p>
