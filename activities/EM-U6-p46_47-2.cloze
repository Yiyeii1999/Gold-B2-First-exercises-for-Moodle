<h4>A good show? Really?</h4>

<p>I love going to the theatre but I am often disappointed <i><u>by</u></i> the show itself, which fails to live {1:SA:=up} to my expectations. So what’s the best way to {1:SA:=find} out whether a particular production is worth seeing? Some people read the critical reviews, but {1:SA:=how} far can they be trusted? There are always glowing tributes outside theatres promising a ‘thrilling’ evening, or a ‘sensational’ show, but many theatre managers choose these advertising quotations {=with} great care. This is because they want to {1:SA:=give} theatre-goers the impression that the reviews were {1:SA:=more} positive than they might have been. One musical was advertised with the words ‘the songs remind you of how fabulous the bands were’, but more negative comments were left {1:SA:=out}. So maybe what we have to do {1:SA:=is} read the reviews carefully, but then trust our own judgement about whether we should pay good money to go and see the show.</p>
