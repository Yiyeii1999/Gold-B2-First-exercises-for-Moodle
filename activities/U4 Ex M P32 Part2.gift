There are many stories of dolphins helping people
in trouble, {~=like} saving swimmers from shark
attacks by gathering round them or shepherding
them to safety. {~=If} these stories are true, why do
dolphins do it and {~=what} jakes them behave in this
way? Scientists {~=who~=that} have studied them are not
entirely sure. For dolphins to act together as a group to
save humans implies that {~=there} is some sort of code
of ethics among dolphins, but there is little evidence 
for that. The {~=most} likely explanation is that they
instinctively respond to the appearance of predators
like sharks by herding weaker members of their own
group into {~=a} safe place - and there is proof that
dolphins do cooperate with {~=each~=each other} other to ward off
danger. Maybe they just mistake swimmers for part
of their group, which would mean that dolphins donâ€™t
have genuine feelings of kindness towards humans.
{~=It} may be that their smiling appearance simply
gives people the wrong idea.
