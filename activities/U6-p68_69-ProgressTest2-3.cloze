<h4>Anyone for bugs?</h4>

<p>In the kitchen of the Archipelago restaurant in London, the head chef is making final <i><u>preparations</u></i> <b>(PREPARE)</b> to one of the salads that has helped to make his restaurant so famous. Taking a wok off the stove, he spoons a {1:SA:~=spicy} <b>(SPICE)</b> red sauce onto a bed of salad leaves. At first {1:SA:~=sight} <b>(SEE)</b>, this could be any other Thai salad, with its chilli, garlic and many other {1:SA:~=colourful} <b>(COLOUR)</b> ingredients. But it's not long before you can recognise the shape of an insect â€“ the thin legs, huge eyes and long tail of a locust. The less {1:SA:~=adventurous} <b>(ADVENTURE)</b> among us would not be too keen on eating insects such as locusts and crickets but they are, in fact, {1:SA:~=surprisingly} <b>(SURPRISE)</b> tasty. Many people find the idea of eating insects {1:SA:~=fascinating} <b>(FASCINATE)</b>. However, for around 2.5 billion of the world's population, insects like these form part of their {1:SA:~=daily~=everyday} <b>(DAY)</b> diet. This is very {1:SA:~=fortunate} <b>(FORTUNE)</b> as they are low in fat, high in protein and full of vitamins as well as being energy efficient.</p>
