<b>Why do they do it?</b>
People are attracted to attempting extreme activities for a {1:SA:=variety} (VARY) of reasons. Some enjoy the challenge, others the feeling of {1:SA:=excitement} (EXCITE) they get from testing themselves. So although their actual {1:SA:=motivation} (MOTIVATE) may differ, people who participate in extreme sports probably share an inability to accept all the {1:SA:=limits} (LIMIT) that most of us think of as normal. They experience a sense of {1:SA:=dissatisfaction} (SATISFY) with the routine of everyday life, and feel a need to push the boundaries of what is possible, to see how far they can go. Is this similar to simply being {1:SA:=competitive} (COMPETE)? Possibly, but it may be more to do with having a dream. Of course {1:SA:=professional} (PROFESSION) athletes who train for extreme events like the triathlon or the marathon may hope for {1:SA:=financial} (FINANCE) rewards, but primarily it seems they like being different. They enjoy the feeling of being set apart from other people by their {1:SA:=achievements} (ACHIEVE), which are things most of us would fear to do.
